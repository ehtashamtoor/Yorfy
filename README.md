# Yorrfy - A React App with Material UI

## Introduction

This project is a **React** application built using **Material UI** for a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with reusable components.
- **Material UI**: Material UI provides a comprehensive set of pre-built, customizable React components that adhere to Google's Material Design guidelines. This simplifies the development process and ensures a consistent, user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building fast and scalable web applications.
- **Material UI**: A React library for building beautiful and functional user interfaces.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ehtashamtoor/yorrfy.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server and open your application in the default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Using Material UI with React

Hereâ€™s how this project is configured to use Material UI:

- **app/layout.tsx**: This file wraps the application with Material UI's `ThemeProvider`. This ensures that Material UI styles are properly applied and available across the application.
- **Optional Font Optimization**: Since Material UI uses custom fonts, you might consider creating a custom component to define typography with `var(--font-roboto)` as the font family. This ensures fonts are loaded efficiently, improving load times.

For further details on integrating Material UI with React, refer to the official documentation: [Material UI React Integration](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/).

## React Features

This project leverages various **React** features:

- **Component-based Architecture**: The UI is split into reusable components, making it easier to manage and scale.
- **State Management**: The React state and context API are used to manage and pass data between components.
- **Performance Optimization**: React provides performance optimizations like virtual DOM and code-splitting to improve user experience.
